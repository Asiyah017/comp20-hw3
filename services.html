			We recognize that teenagers are at their prime time and energy with plenty of time on their hands. However, if they do not get busy with productive activities, they can quickly get involved in detrimental activities <br>

			This is where Youths With A Mission comes in

			We provide youths with an avenue to let out their youthful energy in a productive and fulfilling environent <br>

			Our hope is that at the end of every year, youths aged 11- 19 in the Medford community report a satisfactory year since their involvement with Youth With A Mission <br>

			Further more, we hope to be a community of connection, inspiration, and belonging for Youth in our community
